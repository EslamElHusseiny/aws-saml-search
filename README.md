# aws-saml-declutter

Allows auto-complete searching of accounts/roles on the AWS SAML login form.

Implemented using [Web Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions),
so this should work for both FireFox and Chrome (and probably others too)

## Installing

### FireFox

* Clone this repo to your machine
* Navigate to [about:debugging](about:debugging)
* Click `Load Temporary Add-on`
* Select the manifest.json from the cloned repo
